1. Differentiate between Data Mining and Model Based Optimization.
Data mining is limited by gaps in data after having gathered and summarized. Model Based Optimization
allows the gathered and summarized data to be resampled to create new data.


2. How is Model-based Automated Software Engineering(MASE) different from traditional SE?

Model-based Automated Software Engineering (MASE) is more about the search rather than providing
the services that meet requirements. MASE explores new models as it is concerned with research programming.

3. Give an example of multi objective optimization.

An example of multi objective optimization is designing a car. When designing a car, you are trying
to optimize multiple criteria to produce the best car. You are trying to find the best combination for
a car's fuel efficiency, it's dependability, and it's size, among other aspects. A big car is not likely to be
fuel efficient, so you want to optimize these qualities.

## Theory
1. What does a python function return by default?

It returns None by default.

2. How do you access global variables in python?

You can access a global variable in python by using the global keyword.

3. What is a decorator?

A decorator is syntax that can be placed above a function to call a higher order function.
The decorator extends the behavior of a function using a higher function, without modifying
the original function.

4. What does a seed do in a random number generator?

A seed makes the random number generator repeatable.

5. What happens if an assertion is false?

If an assertion is false, it will throw an exception.
