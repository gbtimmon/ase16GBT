# Implementation of NSGA-II

## Abstract

## Introduction
In this section of Homework the goal was to implement our own version of NSGA-II using knowledge from lectures and implement it
using two versions of comparisons: binary domination (bdom) and continuous domination (cdom). We ran the algorithm against some
of the DTLZ equations, models designed to test optimization algorithms.

## NSGA-II Algorithm
The NSGA-II Algorithm is a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) that takes advantage of a fast non-dominated sorting approach<sup>[1]</sup>.
NSGA-II is an improvement to an original NSGA algorithm. NSGA-II uses crowding distance algorithm to find solutions that are densely 
populated around a specific area and works to spread out the solutions across the objective space.
