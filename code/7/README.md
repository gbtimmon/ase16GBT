# Comparison of Simulated Annealing, MaxWalkSat, and Differential Evolution with DTLZ7 as the model

## Abstract
Conventional methods arrive at optimal solution by compairng all the possible candidate solutions, which grow exponentially with the size of the data.
This practice attempts to compare the performance of Simulated Annealing, MaxWalkSat, and Differential Evolution by running them on the DTLZ7 model with 10 decision variables and 2 objective functions.
