A.Wasserman, Software Engineering Issues for Mobile Application Development, Proc. of the FSE/SDP workshop on Future of software engineering research, FOSER 2010, IEEE Comp. Soc. Press, pp. 397- 400

2. Keywords
	1. Software Engineering - A process by which an individual or team organizes and manages the creation of a software-intensive system
	2. Mobile Devices - A portable computing device such as a smartphone or tablet computer.
	3. Programming Environments - An development environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.
	4. User Interface Design - The appearance and layout of the application is of great importance to allow the user to navigate easily to complete a task and understand the full range of functionality provided.

3. Brief Notes:
	1. Motivational statements - Most applications are small, depending highly on remote server, formal development processes and development tracking are rarely used. Development tools are too much focusing on simplify the task of implementing a mobile application. While it is essential to apply software engineering processes to assure the development of a more complex application.  This paper identified some of these areas which is not transferred from “classic” software engineering techniques. 
	2. Related Work - new fields yielded in mobile development: interaction with other applications, Sensor handling, telephone network or the Internet services, Operating System variety, Security, User Interface and Power consumption . 
	3. Anti-patterns -  Though developers can find a lot of guidance to assist them with programming their applications. Platform developers have drawn on decades of software engineering knowledge to create software architectures and SDKs that provide developers with access to needed device resources. However, these technical aspects don’t address the larger issues of creating large-scale applications. 
	4. New results - options for future application development: develop for a single platform only and use, to the extent possible; develop native applications for each platform to keep maintenance cost low; use web mobile application instead; use abstraction. 
	5. Future work: open questions for future research issues: which function should present in a mobile application and how to maximize code reuse; how sensor data and forms are constructed in an application; is there a need for specific scenario, how different networks affect the performance of application. 

4. Improvements
	1. Most of the future issues are based on the author’s assumption. No further proof is provided in the paper.
	2. No statistical data is provided in the paper to backup the author’s statement.
	3. The data the paper is based on was solicited and collected from mobile developer online forums. This does not account for mobile application user opinions or discuss potential biases of certain groups of developers. 

5. Relates to Reading 2
	1. Reading 2 provide a more detailed explanation with a case study provided in the paper.
	2. Reading 2 includes more areas which is not talked within Reading 3, for instance, the security issues.
